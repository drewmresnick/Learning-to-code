Each file corresponds to different pieces of code I have completed in order to improve my skills in python.

file: Truncate_and_rewrite
Code which deletes text from a specified file and allows tou to write three lines within the empty file.
This code uses the argv module which requires you specifcy the name of the file you will be truncating and rewriting within the command line.

file: calculate_difference
Code which takes in two floats, and returns their relationship. If number "one" is smaller than number "two", the code will return the amount required to make number "one" greater.
